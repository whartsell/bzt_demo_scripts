So what is Taurus?
	Taurus is a performance test centric framework to orchestrate automation of performance testing
	Taurus stands for Test AUtomation RUnning Smoothly
	Taurus is an open source initiative created by Blazemeter. Its a maturing framework (about 3 years old)
	Taurus is not just for jmeter.  It supports ~20 different executers ranging from Jmeter to selenium to Gatling as well as most popular unit test frameworks
	It is designed to be integrated with blazemeter (even a free account) but is not required for most features
	General feature set
		YAML or JSON configuration syntax
		Multiple executers
		Cloud Provisioned Test Execution (Blazemeter account)
		Pass/Fail Criteria
		Test reporting (some require a blazemeter account)
		Services module (utilities streamline tasks for startup,teardown as well as runtime)
		JMX2YAML
		Swagger2YAML
		SoapUI

Why would i use Taurus
	taurus is easier to read and create (mostly)
	Example:
		create and run hello world jmeter script
		create and run hello world taurus script
		POINTS:
			12 lines vs over 80
			human readable
			logging and packaging of artifacts built in
			additional work in jmeter to do the same unless you are running GUI mode (NOT a best practice)
		
	example: integration into jenkins
		create job for the script utilizing the performance plugin
		POINTS:
			simple integration
			already get metrics
			
	Example: pass fail criteria
		add pass fail criteria
		POINTS:
			now we get stable/unstable failed statuses now
